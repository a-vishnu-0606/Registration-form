# Registration-form

A registration form with input validation using JavaScript involves capturing user input for various fields (such as name, email, password, etc.) and verifying its correctness before submission. JavaScript can be used to implement real-time validation by attaching event listeners to input fields. This enables immediate feedback to users, ensuring that data adheres to specified criteria (e.g., proper email format, strong password requirements). Invalid inputs can trigger error messages or visual cues, enhancing user experience and reducing errors during form submission.
